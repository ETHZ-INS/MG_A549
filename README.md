# RNA-seq of GR manipulation in A549 cells

This repository contains the RNA-seq processing and differential expression analysis for the paper 
Gazorpak*, Hugentobler* et al., "Harnessing PROTAC technology to combat stress hormone receptor activation".

The expression data can be obtained as a SummarizedExperiment [here](SE.processed.rds), including DEA results.

For further downstream analysis comparing the results with data from the literature, see the [other repository](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/Glucorticoid-protacs).
